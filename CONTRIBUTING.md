## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Submit a GitHub ticket for your issue if one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
  * A ticket is not necessary for [trivial changes](https://puppet.com/community/trivial-patch-exemption-policy)
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master, run `git checkout -b
    fix/master/my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical and atomic units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.

## Making Trivial Changes

For [changes of a trivial nature](https://puppet.com/community/trivial-patch-exemption-policy), it is not always necessary to create a new
ticket in Jira. In this case, it is appropriate to start the first line of a
commit with one of  `(docs)`, `(maint)`, or `(packaging)` instead of a ticket
number.

If a Jira ticket exists for the documentation commit, you can include it
after the `(docs)` token.

```
    (docs)(DOCUMENT-000) Add docs commit example to CONTRIBUTING

    There is no example for contributing a documentation commit
    to the Puppet repository. This is a problem because the contributor
    is left to assume how a commit of this nature may appear.

    The first line is a real-life imperative statement with '(docs)' in
    place of what would have been the PUP project ticket number in a
    non-documentation related commit. The body describes the nature of
    the new documentation or comments added.
```

For commits that address trivial repository maintenance tasks or packaging
issues, start the first line of the commit with `(maint)` or `(packaging)`,
respectively.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the puppetlabs organization.
* Update your GitHub ticket to mark that you have submitted code and are ready
  for it to be reviewed (Status: Ready for Merge).
  * Include a link to the pull request in the ticket.
* After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two
  weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

## Revert Policy

By running tests in advance and by engaging with peer review for prospective
changes, your contributions have a high probability of becoming long lived
parts of the the project. After being merged, the code will run through a
series of testing pipelines on a large number of operating system
environments. These pipelines can reveal incompatibilities that are difficult
to detect in advance.

If the code change results in a test failure, we will make our best effort to
correct the error. If a fix cannot be determined and committed within 24 hours
of its discovery, the commit(s) responsible _may_ be reverted, at the
discretion of the committer and Puppet maintainers. This action would be taken
to help maintain passing states in our testing pipelines.

The original contributor will be notified of the revert in the Jira ticket
associated with the change. A reference to the test(s) and operating system(s)
that failed as a result of the code change will also be added to the Jira
ticket. This test(s) should be used to check future submissions of the code to
ensure the issue has been resolved.

### Summary

* Changes resulting in test pipeline failures will be reverted if they cannot
  be resolved within one business day.
